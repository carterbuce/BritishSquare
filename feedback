1. Assignment Feedback
----------------------
a) What did you learn by doing this assignment?

	Doing this assignment made me learn a lot more about working with 
	2d arrays and abstract classes. In particular, I learned how to check
	spaces in a 2d array without getting an out of bounds exception by using
	the min and max functions. 


----------------------
b) What was easy about this assignment?

	The easiest part about the assignment was the game that was chosen; if it were
	a different board game than "british square" (which I've never heard of before)
	there would be a lot more complicated operations going on instead of just checking
	if a piece can be placed and then adding one to the score.


----------------------
c) What was harder than you originally thought?

	Printing the board was a lot harder than I initially thought. There were a lot of
	conditions to go through and check before printing different things. For example, 
	I had to check if a space was occupied for both the first and second rows of a cell,
	and it was difficult to set up multiple nested loops and get the board formatted correctly.


----------------------
d) What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	I think the assignment could be improved by using a game we would be familiar with, because
	it was very hard to think of a "good" algorithm 


----------------------
e) What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	I would have liked to use a new concept, maybe learning how to make a gui and making the 
	game board into a gui interface


----------------------
f) What other issues would you like to discuss?

	I really didn't understand what it meant to only use one scanner if there were two humans
